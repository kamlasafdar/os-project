# os-project
Introducing our C++ multi-tasking software project, where we've crafted fifteen different tasks ranging from a calculator to games like Tic Tac Toe.
First In, First Out (FIFO) Approach:
To ensure fairness between tasks, we've adopted a "first come, first served" approach.
Parallel Task Execution:
Our software promotes parallel task execution, allowing you to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously
